# stock-predection-Deeplearning
I've presented an approach to predication stock with deep learning using (DLSTM and LSTM) and GANS also written CNN with Tensorflow. according to the figures of the stock, prediction period time was passed and the direction of movement of the graph is almost correct But the ratio of data had some difference  
                        I need help and advice
Friends who work on or have experience in the prediction of the stock or time series in machine learning share with me what ways I need to go for correct prediction or is it true we can predict stock more precisely?
